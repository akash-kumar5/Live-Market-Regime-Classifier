Real-Time Crpto Market Regime Classification with Deep Learning
=========================================================

A sophisticated, real-time pipeline that uses a multi-timeframe LSTM model to classify cryptocurrency market behavior (e.g., Trend, Range, Volatility Spike) for BTCUSDT, providing live predictions every minute.

### About This Project

This repository contains the complete code for a live inference pipeline that classifies the current market regime of BTCUSDT. The system fetches live data from Binance, processes it through a feature engineering pipeline that considers multiple timeframes (5m, 15m, 1h), and feeds the result into a trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network.

The primary goal is to provide a continuous, real-time signal that can be used to inform algorithmic trading strategies, risk management systems, or market analysis dashboards. For example, a trading algorithm might only take trend-following entries when the model predicts a Strong Trend regime, or tighten stop-losses when a Volatility Spike is predicted.

üîë Key Features
---------------

*   **Real-Time Classification**: Runs continuously to provide minute-by-minute predictions of the current market state.
    
*   **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Enriches the primary 15m data with context from 5m (for immediate momentum) and 1h (for broader trend context) timeframes.
    
*   **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a Keras/TensorFlow LSTM model, ideal for learning from sequential time-series data.
    
*   **Robust Data Pipeline**: Features an intelligent data handler that fetches historical data by date range and seamlessly updates with the latest candle information in real-time.
    
*   **Two Operational Modes**:
    
    1.  **Scheduled Mode**: Runs predictions on fully closed candles at set intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).
        
    2.  **Live Monitor Mode**: Provides "unofficial" predictions every minute by analyzing the in-progress candle.
        
*   **Extensible & Modular**: Code is organized into logical modules for data fetching, feature engineering, and inference, making it easy to adapt or extend.
    

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
---------------

The system operates through a streamlined, multi-stage process:

1.  **Data Prefill**: On startup, the pipeline fetches a 45-day historical dataset for the 5m, 15m, and 1h timeframes from the Binance API. This ensures all technical indicators have a sufficient "warm-up" period.
    
2.  **Live Data Update**: In each cycle, the pipeline fetches only the newest candle data since its last update, efficiently keeping the dataset current.
    
3.  **Timeframe Merging**: The 5m and 1h data are merged onto the primary 15m DataFrame. A merge\_asof operation aligns the timestamps, ensuring each 15-minute candle is enriched with the latest available data from the other timeframes.
    
4.  **Feature Engineering**: A comprehensive set of 36 features (12 for each timeframe) is calculated. These include indicators for trend, momentum, volatility, and price action, such as ema\_slope, adx, atr\_norm, and realized\_vol.
    
5.  **Scaling & Prediction**: The final feature set for the last 64 timesteps is scaled using the same scaler from training and fed into the LSTM model to generate a probability distribution across the six possible market regimes.
    
6.  **Output**: The predicted regime with the highest confidence is displayed, along with the probabilities for all other regimes.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
--------

The pipeline can be run in two distinct modes.

### Scheduled "Official" Predictions

This mode runs predictions at the start of every 5-minute candle, using only closed-candle data. This is the recommended mode for generating signals for a live trading algorithm.

### Live Minute-by-Minute Monitoring

This mode provides a continuous, "unofficial" prediction every minute by analyzing the live, in-progress candle. It's perfect for real-time observation and analysis.
